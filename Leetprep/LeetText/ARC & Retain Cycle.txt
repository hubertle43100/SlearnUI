== ARC ==
- Apple's way of handling memory management of objects	 
- ACR tracks the number of references there are to an object

- In short, the only way to deallocate an object is to remove all the strong reference 
  that is pointing at that object

	(Example) 
	!note - R stands for reference

	R1   --> 	               -   -->
	R2   -->   Person      &       -   -->   Person
	R3   --> 	              R3   -->
	
	If you you try to break two of the strong references by assigning it to nil
	Person cannot be deallocated since there is still one reference still 
	pointing at it.
	
	 -   --> 	               -   -->
	 -   -->   Person      &       -   -->   -
	 -   --> 	               -   -->

	Once the last reference is broken, it shows that the Person object is not
	used anymore and can be removed.
